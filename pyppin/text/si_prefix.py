    """Format a number as a string, using SI (système internationale) prefixes. For example,
    turn 1,234,567 into 1.2M.

    Numbers beyond the range of SI prefixes will be rendered as 1.2E243 (decimal) or 1.2*2^99
    (binary).

    Args:
        value: The number to be formatted.
        mode: Whether to use decimal or binary SI units. (See below for more info)
            Decimal: 1k = 1000
            Binary: 1k = 1024, but use the ordinary symbols k, M, etc.
            IEC: 1k = 1024, but write ki, Mi, etc., as per the IEC80000 standard.
        threshold: How far above the minimum for a prefix to go before using it. For example,
            if the threshold is set to 1.1 and we're in decimal mode, then 1050 will still be
            written as 1050, but 1100 will be written as 1.1k; likewise, 1050000 will be 1050k,
            and 1100000 will be 1.1M.
        precision: The number of digits after the decimal point to show.
        ascii_only: If False, then "micro" will be denoted with μ, as per the standard. If True,
            we use the ASCII letter u instead; this is important for some legacy environments
            that can't support Unicode.
        full_names: If True, then we will print out the full words for the SI prefixes ('Mega',
            'micro', etc) rather than the one-letter abbreviations ('M', 'μ', etc).
            **NOTE:** There are no IEC-defined full names for negative-power prefixes, i.e. no
            IEC equivalents to milli, micro, and so on. For *short* names we can use the IEC
            convention of appending 'i' (mi, μi, etc), but there's no actual full name or rule
            for it that works. As a result, setting mode=IEC, full_names=True will treat all
            values less than one the same way prefix overflows are handled, with '2^-X' instead
            of a name.
        sign: The sign convention we should use when formatting the value.

    Returns:
        A string representation of this number, using SI prefixes.

    Warning
    =======

    Very nasty things, including physical objects crashing into each other at high speeds, have
    happened because of miscommunications about decimal (1k = 1,000) and binary (1k = 1,024)
    prefixes.

    The IEC prefixes are an attempt to fix this, by using 'ki', 'Mi', etc., for binary prefixes, and
    reserving 'k', 'M', etc., for decimal ones. However, IEC notation is only in sporadic use,
    possibly because the associated word forms ('kibi', 'Mebi', etc) sound rather silly. This means
    that if you encounter a numeric prefix in the wild, you need to check to see which one you are
    seeing!

    In general, when IEC prefixes aren't in use, there are some very important conventions to
    follow:

        * Physical quantities, including times, should always use decimal SI prefixes.
        * Storage quantities (in RAM or on disk) should always use binary or IEC prefixes.
        * Network capacities should always use decimal (surprise!) IEC prefixes.

    There are a few surprises hiding in the rules above:

        * Because network capacities are measured in decimal units while data is measured in binary
          units, transmitting 1MB of data (1,048,576 bytes) at 1MBps (1,000,000 bytes per second)
          takes 1.049 seconds, not one second.
        * Network capacities are measured in three different but similar-sounding units: Bps (bytes
          per second of data transmitted), bps (bits per second of data transmitted), and baud
          (line-level transitions per second, i.e. raw bits on the wire per second, including bits
          used for things like error-correcting codes and other things that aren't actual data
          transmitted). bps (note the lowercase!) is by far the most common, to the extent that if
          anyone ever talks to you about Bps you should check if they actually meant that.
          Transmitting 1MB of data at 1Mbps takes 8.39 seconds.
        * Historically, storage quantities on spinning disks were reported by manufacturers in weird
          units that were neither decimal nor binary, like "1MB = 1,024,000 bytes". This is an
          artifact of them trying to make their capacities sound higher without *technically* making
          false or misleading statements. If you encounter numbers like these in the wild, take them
          with a very large grain of salt.
