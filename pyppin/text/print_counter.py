        """A PrintCounter is a context manager that prints regular updates of progress.

        It prints the updates on separate lines, without any VT100 formatting or the like, so it's
        useful in situations where you're writing log files as well as on the console.

        Its use is simple:

        with PrintCounter() as counter:
            ... do some big loop and occasionally call
            counter.inc()

        Every N calls to counter.inc(), or whenever at least Î” time has passed since the last call
        to inc(), it will print out an update statement. The use of both count and time lets you
        edeasily monitor both fast and slow operations and always get useful feedback.

        You can also have "custom counters" by adding keyword arguments to inc(). These counters are
        available in your format string as well to print out, but (unlike the primary counter) they
        will *not* trigger printing.

        Args:
            print_every_n: If not None, print whenever it's been at least N counts since the last
                print happened.
            print_every_time: If not None, print whenever it's been at least X time since the last
                print happened.
            format: The string to print out. This is a standard Python format string, which receives
                the arguments:
                    count: int or float, the current count
                    time: timedelta, the total elapsed time
                    **custom_counts: Any custom counts you created, int or float.
            final_format: If given, the format to be used for the final print string. If None, equal
                to 'format'. Note that the default deliberately uses the raw format for count, not
                the SI one, so you get an exact final count!
            start: The zero time for measurement; the default is now.
            stream: Where to print the result to, or None to print to stdout.
