# Weird hack: The Python docs say that _CData is exposed by ctypes, but the actual CPython
# implementation doesn't do this. (The type is defined and used in _ctypes.c, it just isn't exposed
# in the Python module) However, typeshed (which is used by mypy) follows the docs, not the code,
# which means that the type signature it exposes for io.* _does_ include _CData -- which is actually
# correct, because those classes can accept _CData arguments just fine. The net result is that our
# declarations of [Mutable]BytesLikeObject have to include ctypes._CData, in order to make mypy
# happy, but (until this issue is appropriate addressed) ctypes._CData may well not exist.
# Fortunately, putting in an idiot stub definition suffices, and Python has no objection to my
# importing a module and then monkey-patching it. Which is *totally* a reasonable thing to do,
# right?
# Anyway, hopefully we can fix this in a future Python version and then get rid of this weird little
# logic.
