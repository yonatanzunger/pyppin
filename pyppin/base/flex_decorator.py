# XXX FIX BEFORE PUBLICIZING: Right now there is a type signature problem, so that if you define a
# flex_decorator and use it with parentheses, it will fail mypy with "Untyped decorator makes
# function "my_decorator" untyped" whenever you *use* your decorator. Obviously not acceptable; need
# to fix this.

# A decorated or decorable function is anything bounded by Callable[..., Any]
# A zero-argument decorator maps a decorable function to one of the same signature
# A multi-argument decorator maps kwargs only ... to a zero-argument decorator
# A polydecorator maps *either* a decorated function to one of the same signature, or kwargs only to
#   a zero-argument decorator.
# A flex decorator maps a decorated function plus kwargs to a decorated function
# flex_decorator() maps a flex decorator to a polydecorator


def flex_decorator(decorator: Callable) -> Callable:
    """flex_decorator is a way to simplify writing Python decorators and improve their syntax.

    Usually, if you want to write a decorator without arguments, you have to write one kind of
    function, and the resulting syntax is @foo def bar(), but if you want to write a decorator that
    takes arguments, you have to write a completely different function, and the resulting syntax is
    @foo() def bar. While there are good reasons for this to be the implementation, it's ugly and
    requires remembering too many things for both the writer and user of decorators.

    Instead, @flex_decorator simplifies all of this. You simply need to write

    @flex_decorator
    def my_decorator(target, *, arg, arg, ...):
       ... return the decorated "target"

    You only write one function: it takes exactly one positional argument (the thing to be
    decorated), and arbitrarily many keyword arguments. You can then use the resulting decorator in
    two ways:

    @my_decorator(arg=foo, arg=bar)
    def decorated_thing(...):

    or, if all of the arguments have default values, you can write

    @my_decorator
    def decorated_thing(...):

    This is identical to @my_decorator(), so users no longer need to remember which one to use.

    #       and should return the decorated version of the function, i.e. decorator(_foo). Clearly,
    #       this syntax only works if there are no KW arguments to decorator that lack defaults.

    # SYNTAX 2:
    #   @my_decorator(arg1=X, arg2=Y, ...)

    #         foo = _decorator(_foo)
    #       i.e., poly_decorator is called with only keyword arguments, and should return a zero-
    #       argument decorator which maps _foo onto decorator(_foo, arg1=X, arg2=Y, ...).
