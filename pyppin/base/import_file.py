    Unlike the methods in importlib, this takes an honest-to-Cthulhu *pathname* as its argument.

    WARNING: This will actually exec the file in question, just like importing it would. Do not call
    this on untrusted data for hopefully obvious reasons.

    Args:
        filename: The file to import.
        name: The name of the module to create. If not given, this will default to the name of
            the file.
        reimport: If the name is already imported, and this is true, we'll try to reimport it.
            That said, this is a fragile operation, because any symbols being actively referenced
            from the already-imported file are going to still be there; that is, it has all the same
            caveats as importlib.reload.

    Returns: The newly-imported module.
