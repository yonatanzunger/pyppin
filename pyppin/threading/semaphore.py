        """A semaphore, aka a shared reservoir of (integer) capacity.

        You can acquire some amount of resource from a semaphore, and it guarantees that no more
        than the current capacity will ever be simultaneously held. Acquisitions can specify a
        timeout for how long they want to wait for this to be true, or simply wait forever. Once you
        do acquire capacity, you are responsible for releasing it afterwards!

        The simple (context manager) way to get resource is with ``acquire()``; the low-level
        ``ll_acquire()`` and ``ll_release()`` methods let you directly grab resource without a
        context manager.

        Warning
        =======
        If a code unit (e.g. a thread, or a worker object that can move between threads) acquires
        capacity, it **must not** acquire any further capacity until it has first released what it
        holds. Otherwise you will get a thread-starvation deadlock,ยน which is notoriously hard to
        catch via static analysis or unittests, and only manifests in production under high load,
        when your program suddenly comes to a halt. If you might need more capacity later on in a
        process, acquire the maximum amount of capacity you might need *first* and release some
        later.

        ยน The exact mechanism: Say a worker holds one unit of capacity, and wants to grab one more
        unit of capacity, do something, then release both. Now imagine that many identical workers
        are active at once, so that the semaphore is at capacity. Every one of the workers could
        release some capacity, allowing things to continue, if it could _just_ get one unit of
        capacity -- but there is none, and nobody can release any! The program deadlocks. This is
        especially insidious because the most common reason someone might accidentally do this is if
        workers only *sometimes* need that second unit of capacity. In that case, normally things
        work fine: even if one worker needs an extra unit, some other worker will soon finish its
        task (without needing that) and release capacity. Things only go wrong once there are enough
        workers simultaneously in that special state, which tends to happen in unpredictable
        circumstances but generally in the middle of the night or during a highly-visible public
        event. Don't let this happen to you. Release before you acquire.
