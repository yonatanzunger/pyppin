"""A smarter semaphore that can do things like wait for tasks to finish.

A semaphore is a shared reservior of (integer) capacity.

This is a more sophisticated version of `threading.Semaphore
<https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html#semaphore-objects>`_ and
`threading.BoundedSemaphore
<https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html#threading.BoundedSemaphore>`_: unlike
those classes, this class has a ``stop()`` method, which (irreversibly) prevents further
resource acquisition and blocks until all resources have been released. This lets you do
things like wait until all tasks have completed! It also generalizes a `threading.Barrier
<https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html#threading.Barrier>`_, since unlike a barrier, you
don't have to know ahead of time how many tasks need to be waited for.

Basic Usage
===========

Think of a semaphore as a reservoir of "resource," with some total amount of resource
(optionally infinity) available. You ``acquire()`` some resource at the start of an
operation, blocking until that much of the resource is available; when you're done, you
``release()`` it. This guarantees that you never use more than the available capacity at
once, which makes this an effective throttling tool. You can also change the total available
capacity with ``set_capacity()``, and shut down the entire semaphore with ``stop()``.

Because releasing what you've acquired is so important, Semaphore provides two context
manager API's::

    with semaphore:
        ... do something ...

    with semaphore.get(amount=N, timeout=X, check=bool) as resource:
        if resource:
            ... do something ...
        else:
            ... you couldn't get the capacity! ...

The first syntax grabs one unit of resource, blocking indefinitely, and raises an exception
(BrokenPipeError) if the semaphore somehow got shut down before you could get any. The
second one is a more flexible syntax that lets you control all of these behaviors; with this
syntax, you need to check whether the resource was successfully acquired.

This class is thread-safe.

Useful Ways to Use It
=====================
One common use is to **limit concurrent use of a resource**, such as an RPC server. In this
case, you can create a semaphore with some finite capacity, and have each use grab some
capacity; for example, the program might set ``throttle = Semaphore(5)`` and then have
each worker thread call::

    with throttle:
        ... do the expensive operation ...

Another common use is as a way to **make sure all tasks have finished** in a situation where you
don't know how many tasks will happen ahead of time -- for example, an RPC server might
want to enter a "lame-duck" mode where it stops accepting new requests and waits for pending
ones to finish before shutdown, or a batch job might issue a lot of asynchronous requests
and want to wait for them to finish (and yield their respective outputs) before ending
the job. A semaphore with no concurrency limit (``capacity = None``) does the trick nicely:
simply have every task ``acquire()`` when it starts and ``release()`` when it finishes, and
when you want to end the job as a whole (stop allowing new requests and wait for existing
ones to finish), the thread that wants to wait for things to finish simply calls
``Semaphore.stop()``.

Warning
=======
If a code unit (e.g. a thread, or a worker object that can move between threads) acquires some
units of resource, it **must not** acquire again until it has first released what it
holds. Otherwise you will get a thread-starvation deadlock,ยน which is notoriously hard to
catch via static analysis or unittests, and only manifests in production under high load,
when your program suddenly comes to a halt. If a code flow might need more capacity later,
acquire the maximum amount of capacity you might need up front.

ยน The exact mechanism: Say a worker holds one unit of capacity, and wants to grab one more
unit of capacity, do something, then release both. Now imagine that many identical workers
are active at once, so that the semaphore is at capacity. Every one of the workers could
release some capacity, allowing things to continue, if it could *just* get one unit of
capacity -- but there is none, and nobody can release any! The program deadlocks. This is
especially insidious because the most common reason someone might accidentally do this is if
workers only *sometimes* need that second unit of capacity. In that case, normally things
work fine: even if one worker needs an extra unit, some other worker will soon finish its
task (without needing that) and release capacity. Things only go wrong once there are enough
workers simultaneously in that special state, which tends to happen in unpredictable
circumstances but generally at peak traffic, in the middle of the night, or during a
highly-visible public event. Don't let this happen to you. Release before you acquire.
