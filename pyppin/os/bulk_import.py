    """Import all Python files in a given directory.

    This is useful if, for example, a directory contains implementations which are registered
    through some mechanism that lets them be accessed programmatically! For an example of this,
    look at the implementation of tools/lint.py in the pyppin package itself.

    Args:
        path: The file or directory path from which to start the import.
        recursive: If true, recurse into directories.
        exclude: A list of filename regexps (not globs!) to skip.
        verbose: If true, print when we import things.
        root: If given, modules will be named as dotted components starting from this
            path. By default, it is the same as path. It is often useful to pass your
            repository root here, which will lead to package names that are consistent
            with your repository structure as a whole.

    Returns:
        A dict of all the modules found.

    Example
    =======
    Say your repository looks like this::

        src/
            common/
                superclass.py
                all_types.py
            impls/
                class1.py
                class2.py
                foo/
                    class3.py

    Then `all_types.py` might find its `REPO_ROOT` using `__file__`, and call
    ``bulk_import(f'{REPO_ROOT}/impls', root=REPO_ROOT)``. This would load the modules
    `impls.class1`, `impls.class2`, and `impls.foo.class3`. If those classes were (for example)
    registered using :class:`~pyppin.base.registered_class.RegisteredClass`, you would then be
    able to grab all of them at
    once, without having to maintain a directory in-code of all the implementations.
