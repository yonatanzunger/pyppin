pyppin: A toolkit of Python basics
----------------------------------

pyppin is a library of things that I've either had to implement one time to many in my career (e.g.
lazy-initialized properties) or that are way more complicated than you might guess to do right (e.g.
programmatically importing files or directories). It's a toolbox designed to make Python
programmers' lives easier.

You can browse the documentation here, or simply `read the source
<https://github.com/yonatanzunger/pyppin/tree/master/pyppin>`_, which is thoroughly commented and
is meant to be its own best reference.
