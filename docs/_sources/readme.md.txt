# pyppin: A toolkit of Python basics

pyppin is a library of "basic components" that can be used in a wide range of contexts -- things
that could hypothetically live in a standard library, only there's no particular reason to put them
in there. It is essentially a box of tools that are slightly less common than the basics, but are
nonetheless damned useful in practice. If the main argument against adding something to the standard
library is "why does it need to be in there, as opposed to elsewhere?" and it's not big enough to
merit its own standalone package, this is a perfectly reasonable place to put it.

To find the current catalogue of tools and documentation, either browse the source code (it's
deliberately meant to be readable!) or go to [the documentation](https://yonatanzunger.github.io/pyppin/).
