To build a new release:

* Run `tox test` and `tox lint`. If lint raises any errors, run `tox lint -- --fix`
* Make sure the fields in setup.py are correct.
* Bump the version number in setup.py.
* Compile fresh docs by running tools/docs.py.
* Commit all changes and push to master.

Once master is ready, make a build image and push to prod:
* python setup.py build
* python setup.py install
* twine upload dist/*
