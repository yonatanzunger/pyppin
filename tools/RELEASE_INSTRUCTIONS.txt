To build a new release:

* Basic setup
  * Run `tox`. If lint raises any errors, run `tox lint -- --fix`
  * Make sure the fields in setup.py are correct.
  * Bump the version number in setup.py.
* Image preparation
  * Make sure that docs_src/api.rst contains all the subdirectories of pyppin.
  * Compile fresh docs by running tools/docs.py.
* Commit all changes and push to master.

Once master is ready, make a build image and push to prod:
* python setup.py build
* python setup.py install
* twine upload dist/*
